Semiconductor memory


Semiconductor memory  is a  digital electronic   semiconductor device  used for  digital data storage , such as  computer memory . It typically refers to devices in which data is stored within  metal–oxide–semiconductor  (MOS)  memory cells  on a  silicon   integrated circuit   memory chip . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  There are numerous different types using different semiconductor technologies. The two main types of  random-access memory  (RAM) are  static RAM  (SRAM), which uses several  transistors  per memory cell, and  dynamic RAM  (DRAM), which uses a transistor and a  MOS capacitor  per cell.  Non-volatile memory  (such as  EPROM ,  EEPROM  and  flash memory ) uses  floating-gate  memory cells, which consist of a single  floating-gate transistor  per cell.

Most types of semiconductor memory have the property of  random access , [ 4 ]  which means that it takes the same amount of time to access any memory location, so data can be efficiently accessed in any random order. [ 5 ]  This contrasts with data storage media such as  CDs  which read and write data consecutively and therefore the data can only be accessed in the same sequence it was written.  Semiconductor memory also has much faster  access times  than other types of data storage; a  byte  of data can be written to or read from semiconductor memory within a few  nanoseconds , while access time for rotating storage such as hard disks is in the range of milliseconds.  For these reasons it is used for  primary storage , to hold the program and data the computer is currently working on, among other uses.

As of 2017 [update] , sales of semiconductor memory chips are  $124 billion  annually, accounting for 30% of the  semiconductor industry . [ 6 ]   Shift registers ,  processor registers ,  data buffers  and other small digital registers that have no  memory address decoding mechanism  are typically not referred to as  memory  although they also store digital data.

Description
In a semiconductor memory chip, each  bit  of binary data is stored in a tiny circuit called a  memory cell  consisting of one to several  transistors .  The memory cells are laid out in rectangular arrays on the surface of the chip.  The 1-bit memory cells are grouped in small units called  words  which are accessed together as a single memory address. Memory is manufactured in  word length  that is usually a power of two, typically  N =1, 2, 4 or 8 bits.

Data is accessed by means of a binary number called a  memory address  applied to the chip's address pins, which specifies which word in the chip is to be accessed.  If the memory address consists of  M  bits, the number of addresses on the chip is 2 M , each containing an  N  bit word.   Consequently, the amount of data stored in each chip is  N 2 M  bits. [ 5 ]   The memory storage capacity for  M  number of  address lines  is given by 2 M , which is usually in power of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512  and measured in  kilobits ,  megabits ,  gigabits  or  terabits , etc. As of 2014 [update]  the largest semiconductor memory chips hold a few gigabits of data, but higher capacity memory is constantly being developed.    By combining several integrated circuits, memory can be arranged into a larger word length and/or address space than what is offered by each chip, often but not necessarily a  power of two . [ 5 ] 

The two basic operations performed by a memory chip are " read ", in which the data contents of a memory word is read out (nondestructively), and " write " in which data is stored in a memory word, replacing any data that was previously stored there.  To increase data rate, in some of the latest types of memory chips such as  DDR SDRAM  multiple words are accessed with each read or write operation.

In addition to standalone memory chips, blocks of semiconductor memory are integral parts of many computer and data processing integrated circuits.  For example, the  microprocessor  chips that run computers contain  cache memory  to store instructions awaiting execution.

Types
Volatile memory
Volatile memory  loses its stored data when the power to the memory chip is turned off. However it can be faster and less expensive than non-volatile memory.  This type is used for the main memory in most computers, since data is stored on the  hard disk  while the computer is off.  Major types are: [ 7 ] [ 8 ] 

RAM  ( Random-access memory ) – This has become a generic term for any semiconductor memory that can be written to, as well as read from, in contrast to ROM  (below) , which can only be read.  All semiconductor memory, not just RAM, has the property of  random access .

Non-volatile memory
Non-volatile memory  (NVM) preserves the data stored in it during periods when the power to the chip is turned off.  Therefore, it is used for the memory in portable devices, which don't have disks, and for removable  memory cards  among other uses. Major types are: [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  

History
Early  computer memory  consisted of  magnetic-core memory , as early  solid-state electronic   semiconductors , including  transistors  such as the  bipolar junction transistor  (BJT), were impractical for use as digital storage elements ( memory cells ). The earliest semiconductor memory dates back to the early 1960s, with bipolar memory, which used bipolar transistors. [ 9 ]   Bipolar semiconductor memory  made from  discrete devices  was first shipped by  Texas Instruments  to the  United States Air Force  in 1961. The same year, the concept of  solid-state  memory on an  integrated circuit  (IC) chip was proposed by  applications engineer  Bob Norman at  Fairchild Semiconductor . [ 10 ]  The  first single-chip  memory IC was the BJT 16-bit IBM SP95 fabricated in December 1965, engineered by Paul Castrucci. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  While bipolar memory offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory, it could not compete with the lower price of magnetic-core memory, which remained dominant up until the late 1960s. [ 9 ]  Bipolar memory failed to replace magnetic-core memory because bipolar  flip-flop  circuits were too large and expensive. [ 11 ] 

MOS memory
The advent of the  metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor  (MOSFET), [ 12 ]  invented by  Mohamed M. Atalla  and  Dawon Kahng  at  Bell Labs  in 1959, [ 13 ]  enabled the practical use of  metal–oxide–semiconductor  (MOS) transistors as  memory cell  storage elements, a function previously served by  magnetic cores  in  computer memory . [ 12 ]  MOS memory was developed by John Schmidt at  Fairchild Semiconductor  in 1964. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  In addition to higher performance, MOS memory was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic-core memory. [ 14 ]  This led to MOSFETs eventually replacing magnetic cores as the standard storage elements in computer memory. [ 12 ] 

In 1965, J. Wood and R. Ball of the  Royal Radar Establishment  proposed digital storage systems that use  CMOS  (complementary MOS) memory cells, in addition to MOSFET  power devices  for the  power supply , switched cross-coupling,  switches  and  delay-line storage . [ 16 ]  The development of  silicon-gate   MOS integrated circuit  (MOS IC) technology by  Federico Faggin  at Fairchild in 1968 enabled the production of MOS  memory chips . [ 17 ]   NMOS  memory was commercialized by  IBM  in the early 1970s. [ 18 ]  MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s. [ 14 ] 

The term "memory" when used with reference to computers most often refers to volatile  random-access memory  (RAM). The two main types of volatile RAM are  static random-access memory  (SRAM) and  dynamic random-access memory  (DRAM). Bipolar SRAM was invented by Robert Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963, [ 9 ]  followed by the development of MOS SRAM by John Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964. [ 14 ]  SRAM became an alternative to magnetic-core memory, but required six MOS transistors for each  bit  of data. [ 19 ]  Commercial use of SRAM began in 1965, when IBM introduced their SP95 SRAM chip for the  System/360 Model 95 . [ 9 ] 

Toshiba  introduced bipolar DRAM  memory cells  for its Toscal BC-1411  electronic calculator  in 1965. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  While it offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then dominant magnetic-core memory. [ 22 ]  MOS technology is the basis for modern DRAM. In 1966, Dr.  Robert H. Dennard  at the  IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center  was working on MOS memory. While examining the characteristics of MOS technology, he found it was capable of building  capacitors , and that storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the 1 and 0 of a bit, while the MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor. This led to his development of a single-transistor DRAM memory cell. [ 19 ]  In 1967, Dennard filed a patent under IBM for a single-transistor DRAM memory cell, based on MOS technology. [ 23 ]  This led to the first commercial DRAM IC chip, the  Intel 1103 , in October 1970. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]   Synchronous dynamic random-access memory  (SDRAM) later debuted with the  Samsung  KM48SL2000 chip in 1992. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 

The term "memory" is also often used to refer to  non-volatile memory , specifically  flash memory . It has origins in  read-only memory  (ROM).  Programmable read-only memory  (PROM) was invented by  Wen Tsing Chow  in 1956, while working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation. [ 29 ] [ 30 ]  In 1967, Dawon Kahng and  Simon Sze  of Bell Labs proposed that the  floating gate  of a MOS  semiconductor device  could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable  read-only memory  (ROM), which led to  Dov Frohman  of  Intel  inventing  EPROM  (erasable PROM) in 1971. [ 31 ]   EEPROM  (electrically erasable PROM) was developed by Yasuo Tarui, Yutaka Hayashi and Kiyoko Naga at Japan's  Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI)  Electrotechnical Laboratory  in 1972. [ 32 ]  Flash memory was invented by  Fujio Masuoka  at  Toshiba  in the early 1980s. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]  Masuoka and colleagues presented the invention of  NOR flash  in 1984, [ 35 ]  and then  NAND flash  in 1987. [ 36 ]  Toshiba commercialized NAND flash memory in 1987. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
