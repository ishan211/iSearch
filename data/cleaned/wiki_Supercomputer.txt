A  supercomputer  is a type of  computer  with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in  floating-point  operations per second ( FLOPS ) instead of  million instructions per second  (MIPS). Since 2022, supercomputers have existed which can perform over 10 18  FLOPS, so called  exascale supercomputers . [ 3 ]  For comparison, a desktop computer has performance in the range of hundreds of gigaFLOPS (10 11 ) to tens of teraFLOPS (10 13 ). [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Since November 2017, all of the  world's fastest 500 supercomputers  run on  Linux -based operating systems. [ 6 ]  Additional research is being conducted in the United States, the  European Union , Taiwan, Japan, and China to build faster, more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers. [ 7 ] 

Supercomputers play an important role in the field of  computational science , and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including  quantum mechanics ,  weather forecasting ,  climate research ,  oil and gas exploration ,  molecular modeling  (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological  macromolecules , polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft  aerodynamics , the detonation of  nuclear weapons , and  nuclear fusion ). They have been essential in the field of  cryptanalysis . [ 8 ] 

Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, and for several decades the fastest was made by  Seymour Cray  at  Control Data Corporation  (CDC),  Cray Research  and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran more quickly than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the decade, increasing amounts of  parallelism  were added, with one to four  processors  being typical. In the 1970s,  vector processors  operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful  Cray-1  of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today,  massively parallel  supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] 

The U.S. has long been a leader in the supercomputer field, initially through Cray's nearly uninterrupted dominance, and later through a variety of technology companies. Japan made significant advancements in the field during the 1980s and 1990s, while China has become increasingly active in supercomputing in recent years. As of November 2024 [update] , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's  El Capitan  is the world's fastest supercomputer. [ 11 ]   The US has five of the top 10; Italy two, Japan, Finland, Switzerland have one each. [ 12 ]  In June 2018, all combined supercomputers on the TOP500 list broke the 1 exaFLOPS mark. [ 13 ] 

History
In 1960,  UNIVAC  built the  Livermore Atomic Research Computer  (LARC), today considered among the first supercomputers, for the US Navy Research and Development Center. It still used high-speed  drum memory , rather than the newly emerging  disk drive  technology. [ 14 ]  Also, among the first supercomputers was the  IBM 7030 Stretch . The IBM 7030 was built by IBM for the  Los Alamos National Laboratory , which then in 1955 had requested a computer 100 times faster than any existing computer. The IBM 7030 used  transistors , magnetic core memory,  pipelined  instructions, prefetched data through a memory controller and included pioneering random access disk drives. The IBM 7030 was completed in 1961 and despite not meeting the challenge of a hundredfold increase in performance, it was purchased by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Customers in England and France also bought the computer, and it became the basis for the  IBM 7950 Harvest , a supercomputer built for  cryptanalysis . [ 15 ] 

The third pioneering supercomputer project in the early 1960s was the  Atlas  at the  University of Manchester , built by a team led by  Tom Kilburn . He designed the Atlas to have memory space for up to a million words of 48 bits, but because magnetic storage with such a capacity was unaffordable, the actual core memory of the Atlas was only 16,000 words, with a drum providing memory for a further 96,000 words. The  Atlas Supervisor   swapped  data in the form of pages between the magnetic core and the drum. The Atlas operating system also introduced  time-sharing  to supercomputing, so that more than one program could be executed on the supercomputer at any one time. [ 16 ]  Atlas was a joint venture between  Ferranti  and  Manchester University  and was designed to operate at processing speeds approaching one microsecond per instruction, about one million instructions per second. [ 17 ] 

The  CDC 6600 , designed by  Seymour Cray , was finished in 1964 and marked the transition from  germanium  to  silicon  transistors. Silicon transistors could run more quickly and the overheating problem was solved by introducing refrigeration to the supercomputer design. [ 18 ]  Thus, the CDC6600 became the fastest computer in the world. Given that the 6600 outperformed all the other contemporary computers by about 10 times, it was dubbed a  supercomputer  and defined the supercomputing market, when one hundred computers were sold at $8 million each. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] 

Cray left CDC in 1972 to form his own company,  Cray Research . [ 20 ]  Four years after leaving CDC, Cray delivered the 80 MHz  Cray-1  in 1976, which became one of the most successful supercomputers in history. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  The  Cray-2  was released in 1985. It had eight  central processing units  (CPUs),  liquid cooling  and the electronics coolant liquid  Fluorinert  was pumped through the  supercomputer architecture . It reached 1.9  gigaFLOPS , making it the first supercomputer to break the gigaflop barrier. [ 25 ] 

Massively parallel designs
The only computer to seriously challenge the Cray-1's performance in the 1970s was the  ILLIAC IV . This machine was the first realized example of a true  massively parallel  computer, in which many processors worked together to solve different parts of a single larger problem. In contrast with the vector systems, which were designed to run a single stream of data as quickly as possible, in this concept, the computer instead feeds separate parts of the data to entirely different processors and then recombines the results. The ILLIAC's design was finalized in 1966 with 256 processors and offer speed up to 1 GFLOPS, compared to the 1970s Cray-1's peak of 250 MFLOPS. However, development problems led to only 64 processors being built, and the system could never operate more quickly than about 200 MFLOPS while being much larger and more complex than the Cray. Another problem was that writing software for the system was difficult, and getting peak performance from it was a matter of serious effort.

But the partial success of the ILLIAC IV was widely seen as pointing the way to the future of supercomputing. Cray argued against this, famously quipping that "If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use? Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?" [ 26 ]  But by the early 1980s, several teams were working on parallel designs with thousands of processors, notably the  Connection Machine  (CM) that developed from research at  MIT . The CM-1 used as many as 65,536 simplified custom  microprocessors  connected together in a  network  to share data. Several updated versions followed; the CM-5 supercomputer is a massively parallel processing computer capable of many billions of arithmetic operations per second. [ 27 ] 

In 1982,  Osaka University 's  LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System  used a  massively parallel  processing architecture, with 514  microprocessors , including 257  Zilog Z8001   control processors  and 257  iAPX   86/20   floating-point processors . It was mainly used for rendering realistic  3D computer graphics . [ 28 ]  Fujitsu's VPP500 from 1992 is unusual since, to achieve higher speeds, its processors used  GaAs , a material normally reserved for microwave applications due to its toxicity. [ 29 ]   Fujitsu 's  Numerical Wind Tunnel  supercomputer used 166 vector processors to gain the top spot in 1994 with a peak speed of 1.7  gigaFLOPS (GFLOPS)  per processor. [ 30 ] [ 31 ]  The  Hitachi SR2201  obtained a peak performance of 600 GFLOPS in 1996 by using 2048 processors connected via a fast three-dimensional  crossbar  network. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ]  The  Intel Paragon  could have 1000 to 4000  Intel i860  processors in various configurations and was ranked the fastest in the world in 1993. The Paragon was a  MIMD  machine which connected processors via a high speed two-dimensional mesh, allowing processes to execute on separate nodes, communicating via the  Message Passing Interface . [ 35 ] 

Software development remained a problem, but the CM series sparked off considerable research into this issue. Similar designs using custom hardware were made by many companies, including the  Evans & Sutherland ES-1 ,  MasPar ,  nCUBE ,  Intel iPSC  and the  Goodyear MPP . But by the mid-1990s, general-purpose CPU performance had improved so much in that a supercomputer could be built using them as the individual processing units, instead of using custom chips. By the turn of the 21st century, designs featuring tens of thousands of commodity CPUs were the norm, with later machines adding  graphic units  to the mix. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] 

In 1998,  David Bader  developed the first  Linux  supercomputer using commodity parts. [ 36 ]  While at the University of New Mexico, Bader sought to build a supercomputer running Linux using consumer off-the-shelf parts and a high-speed low-latency interconnection network. The prototype utilized an Alta Technologies "AltaCluster" of eight dual, 333 MHz, Intel Pentium II computers running a modified Linux kernel. Bader ported a significant amount of software to provide Linux support for necessary components as well as code from members of the National Computational Science Alliance (NCSA) to ensure interoperability, as none of it had been run on Linux previously. [ 37 ]  Using the successful prototype design, he led the development of "RoadRunner," the first Linux supercomputer for open use by the national science and engineering community via the National Science Foundation's National Technology Grid. RoadRunner was put into production use in April 1999. At the time of its deployment, it was considered one of the 100 fastest supercomputers in the world. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   Though Linux-based clusters using consumer-grade parts, such as  Beowulf , existed prior to the development of Bader's prototype and RoadRunner, they lacked the scalability, bandwidth, and parallel computing capabilities to be considered "true" supercomputers. [ 37 ] 

Systems with a massive number of processors generally take one of two paths. In the  grid computing  approach, the processing power of many computers, organized as distributed, diverse administrative domains, is opportunistically used whenever a computer is available. [ 39 ]  In another approach, many processors are used in proximity to each other, e.g. in a  computer cluster . In such a centralized  massively parallel  system the speed and flexibility of the  .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#b1d2ff}@media screen{html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#0f4dc9}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .vanchor>:target~.vanchor-text{background-color:#0f4dc9}} interconnect  becomes very important and modern supercomputers have used various approaches ranging from enhanced  Infiniband  systems to three-dimensional  torus interconnects . [ 40 ] [ 41 ]  The use of  multi-core processors  combined with centralization is an emerging direction, e.g. as in the  Cyclops64  system. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] 

As the price, performance and  energy efficiency  of  general-purpose graphics processing units  (GPGPUs) have improved, a number of  petaFLOPS  supercomputers such as  Tianhe-I  and  Nebulae  have started to rely on them. [ 44 ]  However, other systems such as the  K computer  continue to use conventional processors such as  SPARC -based designs and the overall applicability of  GPGPUs  in general-purpose high-performance computing applications has been the subject of debate, in that while a GPGPU may be tuned to score well on specific benchmarks, its overall applicability to everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort is spent to tune the application to it. [ 45 ]  However, GPUs are gaining ground, and in 2012 the  Jaguar  supercomputer was transformed into  Titan  by retrofitting CPUs with GPUs. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 

High-performance computers have an expected life cycle of about three years before requiring an upgrade. [ 49 ]  The  Gyoukou  supercomputer is unique in that it uses both a massively parallel design and  liquid immersion cooling .

Special purpose supercomputers
A number of special-purpose systems have been designed, dedicated to a single problem. This allows the use of specially programmed  FPGA  chips or even custom  ASICs , allowing better price/performance ratios by sacrificing generality. Examples of special-purpose supercomputers include  Belle , [ 50 ]   Deep Blue , [ 51 ]  and  Hydra [ 52 ]  for playing  chess ,  Gravity Pipe  for astrophysics, [ 53 ]   MDGRAPE-3  for protein structure prediction and molecular dynamics, [ 54 ]  and  Deep Crack  for breaking the  DES   cipher . [ 55 ] 

Energy usage and heat management
Throughout the decades, the management of  heat density  has remained a key issue for most centralized supercomputers. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The large amount of heat generated by a system may also have other effects, e.g. reducing the lifetime of other system components. [ 61 ]  There have been diverse approaches to heat management, from pumping  Fluorinert  through the system, to a hybrid liquid-air cooling system or air cooling with normal  air conditioning  temperatures. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  A typical supercomputer consumes large amounts of electrical power, almost all of which is converted into heat, requiring cooling. For example,  Tianhe-1A  consumes 4.04  megawatts  (MW) of electricity. [ 64 ]  The cost to power and cool the system can be significant, e.g. 4 MW at $0.10/kWh is $400 an hour or about $3.5 million per year.

Heat management is a major issue in complex electronic devices and affects powerful computer systems in various ways. [ 65 ]  The  thermal design power  and  CPU power dissipation  issues in supercomputing surpass those of traditional  computer cooling  technologies. The supercomputing awards for  green computing  reflect this issue. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] 

The packing of thousands of processors together inevitably generates significant amounts of  heat density  that need to be dealt with. The  Cray-2  was  liquid cooled , and used a  Fluorinert  "cooling waterfall" which was forced through the modules under pressure. [ 62 ]  However, the submerged liquid cooling approach was not practical for the multi-cabinet systems based on off-the-shelf processors, and in  System X  a special cooling system that combined air conditioning with liquid cooling was developed in conjunction with the  Liebert company . [ 63 ] 

In the  Blue Gene  system, IBM deliberately used low power processors to deal with heat density. [ 69 ]  The IBM  Power 775 , released in 2011, has closely packed elements that require water cooling. [ 70 ]  The IBM  Aquasar  system uses hot water cooling to achieve energy efficiency, the water being used to heat buildings as well. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] 

The energy efficiency of computer systems is generally measured in terms of " FLOPS per watt ". In 2008,  Roadrunner  by  IBM  operated at 376  MFLOPS/W . [ 73 ] [ 74 ]  In November 2010, the  Blue Gene/Q  reached 1,684 MFLOPS/W [ 75 ] [ 76 ]  and in June 2011 the top two spots on the  Green 500  list were occupied by  Blue Gene  machines in New York (one achieving 2097 MFLOPS/W) with the  DEGIMA cluster  in Nagasaki placing third with 1375 MFLOPS/W. [ 77 ] 

Because copper wires can transfer energy into a supercomputer with much higher power densities than forced air or circulating refrigerants can remove  waste heat , [ 78 ]  the ability of the cooling systems to remove waste heat is a limiting factor. [ 79 ] [ 80 ]  As of 2015 [update] , many existing supercomputers have more infrastructure capacity than the actual peak demand of the machine –  designers generally conservatively design the power and cooling infrastructure to handle more than the theoretical peak electrical power consumed by the supercomputer. Designs for future supercomputers are power-limited –  the  thermal design power  of the supercomputer as a whole, the amount that the power and cooling infrastructure can handle, is somewhat more than the expected normal power consumption, but less than the theoretical peak power consumption of the electronic hardware. [ 81 ] 

Software and system management
Operating systems
Since the end of the 20th century,  supercomputer operating systems  have undergone major transformations, based on the changes in  supercomputer architecture . [ 82 ]  While early operating systems were custom tailored to each supercomputer to gain speed, the trend has been to move away from in-house operating systems to the adaptation of generic software such as  Linux . [ 83 ] 

Since modern  massively parallel  supercomputers typically separate computations from other services by using multiple types of  nodes , they usually run different operating systems on different nodes, e.g. using a small and efficient  lightweight kernel  such as  CNK  or  CNL  on compute nodes, but a larger system such as a full  Linux distribution  on server and  I/O  nodes. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] 

While in a traditional multi-user computer system  job scheduling  is, in effect, a  tasking  problem for processing and peripheral resources, in a massively parallel system, the job management system needs to manage the allocation of both computational and communication resources, as well as gracefully deal with inevitable hardware failures when tens of thousands of processors are present. [ 87 ] 

Although most modern supercomputers use  Linux -based operating systems, each manufacturer has its own specific Linux distribution, and no industry standard exists, partly due to the fact that the differences in hardware architectures require changes to optimize the operating system to each hardware design. [ 82 ] [ 88 ] 

Software tools and message passing
The parallel architectures of supercomputers often dictate the use of special programming techniques to exploit their speed. Software tools for distributed processing include standard  APIs  such as  MPI [ 90 ]  and  PVM ,  VTL , and  open source  software such as  Beowulf .

In the most common scenario, environments such as  PVM  and  MPI  for loosely connected clusters and  OpenMP  for tightly coordinated shared memory machines are used. Significant effort is required to optimize an algorithm for the interconnect characteristics of the machine it will be run on; the aim is to prevent any of the CPUs from wasting time waiting on data from other nodes.  GPGPUs  have hundreds of processor cores and are programmed using programming models such as  CUDA  or  OpenCL .

Moreover, it is quite difficult to debug and test parallel programs.  Special techniques  need to be used for testing and debugging such applications.

Distributed supercomputing
Opportunistic approaches
Opportunistic supercomputing is a form of networked  grid computing  whereby a "super virtual computer" of many  loosely coupled  volunteer computing machines performs very large computing tasks. Grid computing has been applied to a number of large-scale  embarrassingly parallel  problems that require supercomputing performance scales. However, basic grid and  cloud computing  approaches that rely on  volunteer computing  cannot handle traditional supercomputing tasks such as fluid dynamic simulations. [ 91 ] 

The fastest grid computing system is the  volunteer computing project   Folding@home  (F@h). As of April 2020 [update] , F@h reported 2.5 exaFLOPS of  x86  processing power. Of this, over 100 PFLOPS are contributed by clients running on various GPUs, and the rest from various CPU systems. [ 92 ] 

The  Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing  (BOINC) platform hosts a number of volunteer computing projects. As of February 2017 [update] , BOINC recorded a processing power of over 166 petaFLOPS through over 762 thousand active Computers (Hosts) on the network. [ 93 ] 

As of October 2016 [update] ,  Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search 's (GIMPS) distributed  Mersenne Prime  search achieved about 0.313 PFLOPS through over 1.3 million computers. [ 94 ]  The PrimeNet server has supported GIMPS's grid computing approach, one of the earliest volunteer computing projects, since 1997.

Quasi-opportunistic approaches
Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing is a form of  distributed computing  whereby the "super virtual computer" of many networked geographically disperse computers performs computing tasks that demand huge processing power. [ 95 ]  Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing aims to provide a higher quality of service than  opportunistic grid computing  by achieving more control over the assignment of tasks to distributed resources and the use of intelligence about the availability and reliability of individual systems within the supercomputing network. However, quasi-opportunistic distributed execution of demanding parallel computing software in grids should be achieved through the implementation of grid-wise allocation agreements, co-allocation subsystems, communication topology-aware allocation mechanisms, fault tolerant message passing libraries and data pre-conditioning. [ 95 ] 

High-performance computing clouds
Cloud computing  with its recent and rapid expansions and development have grabbed the attention of high-performance computing (HPC) users and developers in recent years. Cloud computing attempts to provide HPC-as-a-service exactly like other forms of services available in the cloud such as  software as a service ,  platform as a service , and  infrastructure as a service . HPC users may benefit from the cloud in different angles such as scalability, resources being on-demand, fast, and inexpensive. On the other hand, moving HPC applications have a set of challenges too. Good examples of such challenges are  virtualization  overhead in the cloud, multi-tenancy of resources, and network latency issues. Much research is currently being done to overcome these challenges and make HPC in the cloud a more realistic possibility. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] 

In 2016, Penguin Computing, Parallel Works, R-HPC,  Amazon Web Services ,  Univa ,  Silicon Graphics International ,  Rescale , Sabalcore, and Gomput started to offer HPC  cloud computing . The Penguin On Demand (POD) cloud is a  bare-metal  compute model to execute code, but each user is given  virtualized  login node. POD computing nodes are connected via non-virtualized  10 Gbit/s   Ethernet  or QDR  InfiniBand  networks. User connectivity to the POD  data center  ranges from 50 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s. [ 100 ]  Citing Amazon's EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud, Penguin Computing argues that  virtualization  of compute nodes is not suitable for HPC. Penguin Computing has also criticized that HPC clouds may have allocated computing nodes to customers that are far apart, causing latency that impairs performance for some HPC applications. [ 101 ] 

Performance measurement
Capability versus capacity
Supercomputers generally aim for the maximum in capability computing rather than capacity computing. Capability computing is typically thought of as using the maximum computing power to solve a single large problem in the shortest amount of time. Often a capability system is able to solve a problem of a size or complexity that no other computer can, e.g. a very complex  weather simulation  application. [ 102 ] 

Capacity computing, in contrast, is typically thought of as using efficient cost-effective computing power to solve a few somewhat large problems or many small problems. [ 102 ]  Architectures that lend themselves to supporting many users for routine everyday tasks may have a lot of capacity but are not typically considered supercomputers, given that they do not solve a single very complex problem. [ 102 ] 

Performance metrics
In general, the speed of supercomputers is measured and  benchmarked  in  FLOPS  (floating-point operations per second), and not in terms of  MIPS  (million instructions per second), as is the case with general-purpose computers. [ 103 ]  These measurements are commonly used with an  SI prefix  such as  tera- , combined into the shorthand TFLOPS (10 12  FLOPS, pronounced  teraflops ), or  peta- , combined into the shorthand PFLOPS (10 15  FLOPS, pronounced  petaflops .)  Petascale  supercomputers can process one quadrillion (10 15 ) (1000 trillion) FLOPS.  Exascale  is computing performance in the exaFLOPS (EFLOPS) range. An EFLOPS is one quintillion (10 18 ) FLOPS (one million TFLOPS). However, The performance of a supercomputer can be severely impacted by fluctuation brought on by elements like system load, network traffic, and concurrent processes, as mentioned by Brehm and Bruhwiler (2015). [ 104 ] 

No single number can reflect the overall performance of a computer system, yet the goal of the Linpack benchmark is to approximate how fast the computer solves numerical problems and it is widely used in the industry. [ 105 ]  The FLOPS measurement is either quoted based on the theoretical floating point performance of a processor (derived from manufacturer's processor specifications and shown as "Rpeak" in the TOP500 lists), which is generally unachievable when running real workloads, or the achievable throughput, derived from the  LINPACK benchmarks  and shown as "Rmax" in the TOP500 list. [ 106 ]  The LINPACK benchmark typically performs  LU decomposition  of a large matrix. [ 107 ]  The LINPACK performance gives some indication of performance for some real-world problems, but does not necessarily match the processing requirements of many other supercomputer workloads, which for example may require more memory bandwidth, or may require better integer computing performance, or may need a high performance I/O system to achieve high levels of performance. [ 105 ] 

The TOP500 list
Since 1993, the fastest supercomputers have been ranked on the TOP500 list according to their  LINPACK benchmark  results. The list does not claim to be unbiased or definitive, but it is a widely cited current definition of the "fastest" supercomputer available at any given time.

This is a list of the computers which appeared at the top of the  TOP500 list  since June 1993, [ 108 ]  and the "Peak speed" is given as the "Rmax" rating. In 2018,  Lenovo  became the world's largest provider for the TOP500 supercomputers with 117 units produced. [ 109 ]

Applications
The stages of supercomputer application are summarized in the following table:

The IBM  Blue Gene /P computer has been used to simulate a number of artificial neurons equivalent to approximately one percent of a human cerebral cortex, containing 1.6 billion neurons with approximately 9 trillion connections. The same research group also succeeded in using a supercomputer to simulate a number of artificial neurons equivalent to the entirety of a rat's brain. [ 121 ] 

Modern weather forecasting relies on supercomputers. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  uses supercomputers to crunch hundreds of millions of observations to help make weather forecasts more accurate. [ 122 ] 

In 2011, the challenges and difficulties in pushing the envelope in supercomputing were underscored by  IBM 's abandonment of the  Blue Waters  petascale project. [ 123 ] 

The  Advanced Simulation and Computing Program  currently uses supercomputers to maintain and simulate the United States nuclear stockpile. [ 124 ] 

In early 2020,  COVID-19  was front and center in the world. Supercomputers used different simulations to find compounds that could potentially stop the spread. These computers run for tens of hours using multiple paralleled running CPU's to model different processes. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] 

Development and trends
In the 2010s, China, the United States, the European Union, and others competed to be the first to create a 1  exaFLOP  (10 18  or one quintillion FLOPS) supercomputer. [ 128 ]  Erik P. DeBenedictis of  Sandia National Laboratories  has theorized that a zettaFLOPS (10 21  or one sextillion FLOPS) computer is required to accomplish full  weather modeling , which could cover a two-week time span accurately. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ]  Such systems might be built around 2030. [ 132 ] 

Many  Monte Carlo simulations  use the same algorithm to process a randomly generated data set; particularly,  integro-differential equations  describing  physical transport processes , the  random paths , collisions, and energy and momentum depositions of neutrons, photons, ions, electrons, etc.  The next step for microprocessors may be into the  third dimension ; and specializing to Monte Carlo, the many layers could be identical, simplifying the design and manufacture process. [ 133 ] 

The cost of operating high performance supercomputers has risen, mainly due to increasing power consumption. In the mid-1990s a top 10 supercomputer required in the range of 100 kilowatts, in 2010 the top 10 supercomputers required between 1 and 2 megawatts. [ 134 ]  A 2010 study commissioned by  DARPA  identified power consumption as the most pervasive challenge in achieving  Exascale computing . [ 135 ]  At the time a megawatt per year in energy consumption cost about 1 million dollars. Supercomputing facilities were constructed to efficiently remove the increasing amount of heat produced by modern multi-core  central processing units . Based on the energy consumption of the Green 500 list of supercomputers between 2007 and 2011, a supercomputer with 1 exaFLOPS in 2011 would have required nearly 500 megawatts. Operating systems were developed for existing hardware to conserve energy whenever possible. [ 136 ]  CPU cores not in use during the execution of a parallelized application were put into low-power states, producing energy savings for some supercomputing applications. [ 137 ] 

The increasing cost of operating supercomputers has been a driving factor in a trend toward bundling of resources through a distributed supercomputer infrastructure. National supercomputing centers first emerged in the US, followed by Germany and Japan. The European Union launched the  Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe  (PRACE) with the aim of creating a persistent pan-European supercomputer infrastructure with services to support scientists across the  European Union  in porting, scaling and optimizing supercomputing applications. [ 134 ]  Iceland built the world's first zero-emission supercomputer. Located at the Thor Data Center in  Reykjavík , Iceland, this supercomputer relies on completely renewable sources for its power rather than fossil fuels. The colder climate also reduces the need for active cooling, making it one of the greenest facilities in the world of computers. [ 138 ] 

Funding supercomputer hardware also became increasingly difficult. In the mid-1990s a top 10 supercomputer cost about 10 million euros, while in 2010 the top 10 supercomputers required an investment of between 40 and 50 million euros. [ 134 ]  In the 2000s national governments put in place different strategies to fund supercomputers. In the UK the national government funded supercomputers entirely and high performance computing was put under the control of a national funding agency. Germany developed a mixed funding model, pooling local state funding and federal funding. [ 134 ] 

In fiction
Examples of supercomputers in fiction include  HAL 9000 ,  Multivac ,  The Machine Stops ,  GLaDOS ,  The Evitable Conflict ,  Vulcan's Hammer ,  Colossus ,  WOPR ,  AM , and  Deep Thought . A supercomputer from  Thinking Machines  was mentioned as the supercomputer used to sequence the  DNA  extracted from preserved parasites in the  Jurassic Park  series.
