Etymonline


Etymonline , or  Online Etymology Dictionary , sometimes abbreviated as  OED  (not to be confused with the  Oxford English Dictionary , which the site often cites), is a free  online dictionary  that describes the  origins  of  English   words , written and compiled by Douglas R. Harper. [ 1 ] 

Description
Douglas R. Harper, an  American Civil War  historian and copy editor for  LNP Media Group , [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  compiled the etymology dictionary to record the history and evolution of more than 50,000 words, including slang and technical terms. [ 4 ]  The core body of its etymology information stems from  The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology  by  Robert Barnhart ,  Ernest Klein 's  Comprehensive Etymology Dictionary of the English Language ,  The Middle English Compendium ,  The Oxford English Dictionary , and the 1889â€“1902  Century Dictionary . [ 5 ]  Harper also researches on  digital archives . On the  Etymonline  homepage, Harper says that he considers himself "essentially and for the most part" a compiler and evaluator of etymology research made by others.

Reviews and reputation
The  Online Etymology Dictionary  has been referenced by  Oxford University 's "Arts and Humanities Community Resource" catalog as "an excellent tool for those seeking the origins of words" [ 6 ]  and cited in the  Chicago Tribune  as one of the "best resources for finding just the right word". [ 7 ]  It is cited in academic work as a useful, though not definitive, reference for etymology. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  In addition, it has been used as a data source for quantitative scholarly research. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
