A  calculation  is a deliberate  mathematical  process that transforms a plurality of inputs into a singular or plurality of outputs, known also as a result or results. The term is used in a variety of senses, from the very definite  arithmetical  calculation of using an  algorithm , to the vague  heuristics  of calculating a strategy in a competition, or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people.

For example,  multiplying  7 by 6 is a simple algorithmic calculation. Extracting the  square root  or the  cube root  of a number using mathematical models is a more complex algorithmic calculation.

Statistical estimations  of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers.

To  calculate  means to determine mathematically in the case of a number or amount, or in the case of an abstract problem to deduce the answer using  logic ,  reason  or  common sense . [ 1 ]  The English word derives from the  Latin   calculus , which originally meant a  pebble  (from Latin  calx ), for instance the small stones used as a counters on an  abacus  (Latin:  abacus ,  Greek :  ἄβαξ ,  romanized :  abax ). The abacus was an instrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the  slide-rule  and the  electronic calculator , and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on iron bars.
