Richard Brathwait


Richard Brathwait  (or  Brathwaite, Braithwaite ) (1588 – 4 May 1673) was an English  poet .

Life
Brathwait was born at Burnishead, near  Kendal . He entered  Oriel College, Oxford  in 1604, and remained there for some years, pursuing the study of poetry and Roman history. He moved to  Cambridge  to study law at the  university  and afterwards to London to the  Inns of Court . His father, Thomas, died in 1610, and Brathwait went down to live on the estate he inherited. [ 1 ]  He was married [ 2 ]  at  Hurworth  in  County Durham , 4 May 1617, to Frances, daughter of James Lawson, of  Nesham Abbey .

In 1633 his wife died, and in 1639 he married again. His only son by this second marriage, Sir Strafford Brathwait, was killed at sea. [ 1 ]  Brathwait is believed to have served with the  Royalist  army in the  Civil War .

He was the author of many works of very unequal merit, of which the best known is  Drunken Barnaby's Four Journeys , which records his pilgrimages through  England  in rhymed Latin (said by Southey to be the best of modern times), and doggerel English verse.  The English Gentleman  (1631) and  English Gentlewoman  are in a much more decorous strain. Other works are  The Golden Fleece  (1611) (poems),  The Poet's Willow ,  A Strappado for the Devil  (a satire), and  Art Asleepe, Husband? 

His 1613 book  The Yong Mans Gleanings  contains the first known use of the word " computer "; he used the word to refer to an " arithmetician ". [ 3 ] 

An extract from both  Drunken Barnaby  and his “epitaph to Frances, (his wife)” appears in  The Bishoprick Garland  by (Sir)  Cuthbert Sharp .
